- kNN disadvantages for image classification
    - classifier must remember all of the training data
    - Classifying a test image is expensive since it requires a comparison to all training images

# New approach for image classification

- Score function
    - maps the raw data to class scores
- Loss function (cost function / objective function)
    - quantifies the agreement between the predicted scores and the ground truth labels
- Multiclass Support Vector Machine loss

# Practical Considerations

# Softmax classifier
